#### Private Cloud (Private Cloud Datacenter )

Private Datacenter using Cloud Principles to supply your own necessities

#### Communiy Cloud (Community Cloud Datacenter)

Private datacenter shared between many companies (Ex.: Government sharing a cloud datacenter between their groups)

#### Public Cloud (Public Cloud Datacenter)

Public Datacenter shared between anyone. Ayone can buy a service in that infrastructure

#### Hybrid Cloud (Public + Private/Community)



## Cloud Project Stages

* Indentify a Problem
* Set a Goal (HA, Low Cost, Auto Scale, performance)
* Choose services
* Build
* Optimization
